# Vulkan
Vulkan is a low-level, cross-platform 3D graphics and compute [[Notes/Application Programming Interface\|API]] developed by the [[Notes/Khronos Group\|Khronos Group]], a consortium of hardware and [[Notes/Software\|software]] companies. It was first released in 2016 as a successor to OpenGL, which is a widely-used graphics [[Notes/Application Programming Interface\|API]].

Vulkan is designed to provide a more efficient and scalable way of interacting with graphics hardware than previous graphics APIs. It allows developers to have more fine-grained control over the graphics pipeline, which can lead to better performance and more efficient use of system resources.

Some of the key features of Vulkan include:

- Explicit control over memory management: Vulkan requires the developer to explicitly manage memory, which allows for more efficient use of resources and can help avoid memory-related performance issues.

- Multi-threading support: Vulkan is designed to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, allowing for more efficient use of available processing power.

- Asynchronous execution: Vulkan allows for asynchronous execution of commands, which can lead to improved performance and a more responsive user experience.

- Cross-platform support: Vulkan is designed to work on a wide range of platforms, including desktop and mobile operating systems.

Overall, Vulkan is a powerful graphics [[Notes/Application Programming Interface\|API]] that provides developers with more control over the rendering pipeline, allowing them to achieve higher performance and efficiency on a wide range of platforms.
