# Vertex Buffer Object
Multiple [[Inbox/Vertex Buffer Object\|VBOs]] are held by the [[Inbox/Vertex Array Object\|VAO]], and each [[VBO\|VBO]] holds different "property" of the object required for rendering. For example, one [[Inbox/Vertex Buffer Object\|VBO]] will hold information of color, another for position, and so on.
