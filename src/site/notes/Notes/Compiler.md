# Compiler
A compiler is a [[Notes/Software\|software]] tool that translates source code written in a high-level [[Notes/Programming\|programming]] language into machine code that can be executed by a computer. The process of compilation involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.

During the lexical analysis stage, the compiler breaks the source code into a sequence of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, and operators. The syntax analysis stage checks that the tokens form a valid program according to the rules of the [[Notes/Programming\|programming]] language's grammar. The semantic analysis stage checks that the program is semantically correct, such as checking that variables are declared before they are used.

Once the program has been analyzed and validated, the compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the computer's processor. The generated code may be optimized to improve performance, such as by removing redundant instructions or reordering instructions to take advantage of the processor's [[Notes/CPU Pipeline\|pipeline]].

Compilers are essential tools for [[Notes/Software\|software]] development, as they allow programmers to write code in a high-level language that is easier to read and maintain than machine code. Compilers also enable code to be ported to different platforms and architectures, as the generated machine code is specific to the target platform.
