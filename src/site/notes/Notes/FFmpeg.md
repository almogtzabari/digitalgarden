### What is FFmpeg?
>**FFmpeg** is a [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") project consisting of a suite of [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing) "Library (computing)") and [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") for handling video, audio, and other [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia "Multimedia") files and streams. At its core is the [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") `ffmpeg` tool itself, designed for processing of video and audio files. It is widely used for format [transcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding "Transcoding"), basic editing (trimming and [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation "Concatenation")), [video scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler "Video scaler"), video [post-production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production "Post-production") effects and standards compliance ([SMPTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Engineers "Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers"), [ITU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union")).
