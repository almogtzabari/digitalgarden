# Instruction Count
[[Notes/Instruction Count\|Instruction Count]] is the number of instructions that need to be executed by the [[Notes/CPU\|CPU]] in order for the program to finish.
Usually it is denoted as **IC**.

To minimize the [[Notes/Instruction Count\|IC]] of a program we need to change the architecture ([[Notes/Instruction Set Architecture\|ISA]]?).
