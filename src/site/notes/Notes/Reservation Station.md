# Reservation Station
A [[Notes/Reservation Station\|Reservation Station]] is some kind of a queue for execution units inside an [[Notes/Out Of Order Execution\|Out Of Order Execution]] [[Notes/Central Processing Unit\|Central Processing Unit]].

Each execution unit (Integers/Floating Point, etc.) has its own [[Notes/Reservation Station\|Reservation Station]]. 

Instructions wait in [[Notes/Reservation Station\|Reservation Station]]s until all their operands are ready AND the execution unit is ready.
