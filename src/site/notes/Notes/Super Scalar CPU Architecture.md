# Super Scalar CPU Architecture
[[Notes/Super Scalar CPU Architecture\|Super Scalar CPU Architecture]] means that we take **SOME** of the [[Notes/CPU Pipeline#Example for different stages in a pipe\|stages in a pipe]] and duplicate them, allowing **SOME** parts of the CPU to operate in parallel.

>[!ATTENTION]
>**This does not mean Multi-Core**.
>Multi-Core means that the entire CPU (along with **ALL** [[Notes/CPU Pipeline\|pipeline]] stages) are duplicated.
